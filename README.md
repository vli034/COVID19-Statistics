# NeedFinding and Competitive analysis 
Top 5 new functionalities
1) Speech recogniition in their native language - Older POC(People of Color) tend to mainly speak their native tongue and have poor english skills. A new feature on this app that can prove to benefical for older people is where they can speak into the application and have it open up screens that they are looking for. If it can not tell what they are looking for it will be directed to a representative.

2) Active pointers  - The elderly are not familiar with mobile applications and so they might not understand what buttons to press. If  we could add suggestie pointers within the application for each screen. Like a pop up that says "click here to talk to someomeone" or "click here to view numbers". I believe that would be helpful for the eldery.

3) Fixed zoom option - Since some eldery people have poor eyesight we can provide an option where they can read the app at a specfic zoomed in level that allows them to use the app coherently 

4) Direct Assistance  - Some old people live alone or do not have family. In this scenario, if they were to catch Covid they would need assistance in getting to a hospital or testing center. Perhaps we provide and option that allows elderly people to contact a medical professional to provide them assistance

5) Link to apple watch - in the scenario of olderly people who are healthy and active we could have the application link to their apple watch to check if they were in the perimeter of red zone areas. If they were maybe exposed to teh virus it would provide a notfication to the person as well as updating the application on flagged /high traffic areas.
